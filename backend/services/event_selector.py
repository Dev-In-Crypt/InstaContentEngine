"""Deciding which source items are worth posting about — explainable rules only.

The riskiest part of the Business module is selection: too much junk and a person
stops trusting the feed. So the rules are deliberately simple and legible (doc §5),
never ML — every verdict comes with a one-line reason a human can sanity-check.

A verdict is one of:
- "worthy"    — a real event (customer impact, a concrete result, a launch, a change).
- "weak"      — nothing wrong, but no strong signal; still shown, just flagged.
- "duplicate" — a matching item was already seen recently (caller supplies the window).

Pure functions so the rules are testable and the selection is reproducible.

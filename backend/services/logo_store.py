"""The tenant's brand logo — one persistent file per user, drawn on every slide.

Unlike staging (a scratch area swept after a day), a logo lives until the tenant
replaces or removes it. It is keyed by user id, the path is always built from that
id server-side, and every read re-checks the resolved path is inside the logo
folder — a client never names a file on our disk.
